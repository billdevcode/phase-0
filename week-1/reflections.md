## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I was most interested in the pomodoro technique and tiny habits. 
Both feels simple enough to just pick-up and use immediately.  

Time Boxing is a way to organize time, we determine a time period and 
just work during that time period towards some goal. Once the time is 
reached, we stop and evaluate what was accomplished during that period of time.

Currently I do not use a systematic way of managing my time so I just work and 
stop as needed. I don't think this strategy works well because sometimes I get 
distracted by something and spend too much time on non-DBC stuff. 

Today I took out my digital watch and I set the timer to 25 minutes then once 
it beeps I take a 5 minutes break (Pomodoro technique). I can already feel 
my productivity increase today! The tiny habit I will start with is: 
everyday I log into my computer, I will review 2 DBC feedback.  
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to incorporate these 2 techniques in my everyday life. 

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A **shell** is an user-interface used to access an operating system typically through 
a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). 
**Bash** is an Unix shell and command language.

I went through the video and the crash course and I used all the commands successfully 
on Cloud9. The challenging part was trying to remember the commands but I've used MS-DOS 
in the past before so I'll get the hang of this after more usage.

I'm guessing there are many, many other commands we didn't get to see on the video and 
crash course so in my opinion, the crash course talked about the most important commands. 

1. pwd - print working directory or display your current full directory path
2. ls - list the contents of current directory
3. mv - move or rename files
4. cd - change directory
5. ../ - move up a directory path
6. touch - make an empty file
7. mkdir - make a directory 
8. less - view a file (default is first 10 lines)
9. rmdir - removes an empty directory
10. rm - remove a file
11. help - see a list of the commands

## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

#### How to create a new repository:
1. Go to your Github account and click the plus (**+**) sign on the top right and choose **New repository**
2. Give the repository a name (for example: devbootcamp-is-awesome) 
3. Add the MIT license
4. Click **Create repository**

#### How to fork a new repository:
1. Go to the repository you want to fork and click **Fork** on the top right
2. That's it! Now you have your own copy of the forked repository.

#### How to clone a repository:
1. Go to your repository page and find the link next to **HTTPS**
2. Copy the link by clicking the **clipboard** button on the right
3. From your terminal, go to the folder you want the repository to save at
4. Input the commands "git clone *LINK*" where *LINK* is the copied repository link

When we fork a repository, we are copying a project from one Github account to 
another Github account and we can sync with the original project or we may go a different direction. 

I didn't run into any struggles setting up Git and Github but I did learn the 
difference of setting up a repository on the web then cloning it locally versus 
setting up a repository locally then merging it with the web.

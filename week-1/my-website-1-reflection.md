#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/billdevcode/billdevcode.github.io

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
##### How to create a new repository:
1. Go to your Github account and click the plus (**+**) sign on the top right and choose **New repository**
2. Give the repository a name (for example: devbootcamp-is-really-awesome)
3. Add the MIT license
4. Click **Create repository**

##### How to clone a repository:
1. Go to your repository page and find the link next to **HTTPS**
2. Copy the link by clicking the **clipboard** button on the right
3. From your terminal, go to the folder you want the repository to save at
4. Input the commands "git clone *LINK*" where *LINK* is the copied repository link

#### Describe what open source means.
Open source means the source code is provided to the public for free. 

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Personally I think **open source** is great!
It means I have many free resources available for use on my projects and 
I can study how others write their codes. 

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.
License protects the original creator of the codes by preventing others in claiming 
the work as theirs and by receiving credit as the original creator. 

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I have seen Github hosted pages before and I tried to put one together but I could never
get it to work. Today was my "AHA!" momemt. 

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

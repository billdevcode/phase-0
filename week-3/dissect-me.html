1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used the <main> and <section> tags because all major websites have main contents as well 
as multiple sections to separate the page. This includes my own personal site too. 

2. How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The elements are displayed based on being inside the <body> tag and it goes from the outer elements 
to their inner nested elements. 

3. What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets 
at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I'm using Cloud9 but I have Sublime locally and it was nice to create the snippet. I learned we can
create a snippet for anything that Sublime supports. I will definitely create more snippets at a later date.

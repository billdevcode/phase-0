#### What does puts do?
`puts` returns `nil` and prints the output to the console with a new line.

#### What is an integer? What is a float?
Integer is a whole number without decimal while a float is a number with decimal. 

#### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
The difference is that integer division rounds down to a whole number without decimal while a float division 
won't. When we do arithmetic with integers, we'll get integer answers and in integers `9 / 2 = 4` but if 
we do arithmetic with floats then `9.0 / 2.0 = 4.5`. So it's just a way the computer separates numbers 
into two groups since most programs don't use floats, for example we can't read 7.4 emails or watch browse 1.7 
web pages. 

* Hours in a year
```ruby
365 * 24 
=> 8760
```

* Minutes in a decade
```ruby
365 * 24 * 60 * 10
=> 5256000
```
#### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Ruby handles these math operations similar to the way a calculator handles it except 
division which Ruby separates into 2 ways depending if you used integers or floats.

#### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are a group of letters and we use strings whenever we want to print letters, words or text. 

#### What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Variables are used to store objects and we use it so we don't have to print something out more than once or 
we want to store an object somewhere for later use. 

#### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
The challenge refreshed the basics of Ruby, which is nice so we don't jump right into 
something too difficult. I think the more challenging part was the instructions were a bit 
confusing because each exercise asked us to submit the link and if we did then we would 
have to submit 4 links including this one.

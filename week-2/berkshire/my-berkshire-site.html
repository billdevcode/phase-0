- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was a blast to apply what I've learned into an actual site and allow me to reinforce my learning.
  
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  I was confused about the <section> tag and applied it throughout our initial draft
  but the HTML validation tool suggested to remove it so our final version only has 1 <section> tag.
  
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We followed the no-formatting rule so our site is quite plain but even the real Berkshire site is 
  pretty plain.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  I think HTML is good in what it does which is structuring the site and separating 
  different areas. On the other hand, I think it's very easy to accidentally mess up 
  due to all the required opening and closing of the tags. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I don't have any tricks but I believe through practice and repetition, anyone 
  can remember how to write HTML.

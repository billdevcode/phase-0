## Site Map Reflection and Submission

#### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1. Information Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing and Delivery
6. Maintenance

#### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's primary purpose is to show off my projects and blog to DBC, cohorts, friends and potential employers in the future.
It should feature projects I will be building, my blogs and information about me such as my developer skills.

#### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience's interests are:
* Who is Bill and what projects has he built?
* What developer skills does Bill have?
* How can I contact Bill?

My site will address this with About Me, Projects and Contacts pages. 

#### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary action should be to look at my projects portfolio since it shows the result of my time at DBC.

#### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Design and user experience are both useful and important for companies to increase revenue and share information with 
their customers and potential customers. The main things are to figure out the site's purpose, goal, target audience and audience needs. 

#### What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is a design that focuses on providing the best user experience. 
This is valuable and important because it determines whether the user enjoys using the website or not.
A user who does not enjoy using a website will eventually stop using it.   

#### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I think some parts of the User Experience Design article were tedious and sounded like common sense such as the topics: 
"Projects With "OK" Budgets" and "UX Design is Not One Size Fits All".
